# iOS Workshop for MHacks X

Make sure you have downloaded and installed the latest copy of [Xcode 9](https://developer.apple.com/download/). 

Check out the slides if you'd like. 

Also, I highly recommend downloading and having both the starter project and completed project open. This way if you are left behind or are not sure what the final code is supposed to look like you can always refer to the final project. The starter project has a lot of the bare bones of the final app.

There are a lot of techniques for beginners but we will also explore some more advanced techniques so that even people a little more experienced learn something new. The final version of the app itself is pretty complicated, however, if you are a beginner, fear not!


Finally, I hope you have fun and learn a bunch! :)
